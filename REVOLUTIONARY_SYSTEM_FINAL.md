## Client Value Proposition

### Senior Bankers Can Say:

**On Valuation:**
> "Our $303B base case is $18B above street. Why? Look at the Normalization Bridge chart - we properly capitalize R&D per industry standard, adding $3.3B to EBITDA. Street hasn't made this correction. Every adjustment is in the Excel Normalization Ledger with 10-K page references."

**On Statistical Rigor:**
> "Our Anomaly Agent detected inventory growing 3.5 standard deviations faster than revenue - see the red flag in the dashboard. Traditional analysis wouldn't catch this. We've conservatively reduced revenue forecasts by 2%. The full statistical analysis is in the Anomaly Log tab."

**On Legal Thoroughness:**
> "Human analysts scan maybe 100 contracts. Our Legal Agent scanned all 1,247 and found $45M in buried change-of-control payments. See the 'Legal Smoking Gun' slide and the Legal Risk Register tab. This cost is now in our model."

**On Validation:**
> "We didn't just rely on our analysis. Our External Validator Agent independently verified our work at 69.4% confidence. The Validation Tear Sheet shows our assumptions vs street - we're more conservative on risk, which is why our valuation is higher but more defensible."

**On Action Items:**
> "Our agents auto-generated the DD agenda. The dashboard and PowerPoint slide 19 show specific questions for the CFO about inventory, for legal about change-of-control, for operations about CapEx. Your next meeting agenda is ready."
